### Motivation

In the wake of Covid-19 and social unrest, crime rates are steadily increasing, especially in urban areas. Walking somewhere could be especially dangerous if the person isn't aware of the current crime rates in the area.

### Features

The safest path finder maps out the safest and shortest path using Dijstra's Shortest Path algorithm. We have implemented a crime rate generator that assigns specific areas with the current crime rate on a scale of 1-10. We also have implemented a simulator that maps out the route to the destination.

### Challenges we had to face

Since we are currently taking an intro Data structures and Algorithms course, our knowlege of pathfinding algorithms is limited. It was very challenging working virutually with the team since Covid-19 has closed down our college campus for the summer and not all of us has the same experience with pygame/python.

## Prerequisites
### Software/Libraries

- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) 
- [Python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


# Python installation tips

Our project requires python 3.0 and above. To check your version of python you can use this command into your terminal window.
``` 
python --version
```

You can download the latest version of python directly from this website [Python3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


### Pygame Installion tips
We recomend installing pygame to avoid any conflicts with running the simulator. There has been some issues with runnning pygame on MacOS so this forum might help with the installation (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52718921/problems-getting-pygame-to-show-anything-but-a-blank-screen-on-macos-mojave)

In order to download the Pygame Library you can use this command in your terminal
```
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Program

Download the zip file, enter the folder's current directory. Then enter this command to get visual or readable directions.
```python3
python3 main.py
```



### Next Steps for Safest Path Finder

If we had more time we would implement: 
- [Using Google's Map API to get directions in real time]
- [Updating the user experience by making an Andriod/Iphone application]
